[ Description ]
An issue was discovered in janus-gateway (aka Janus WebRTC Server) through 0.10.0. janus_sdp_process in sdp.c has a NULL pointer dereference.

[Vulnerability Type]
NULL pointer dereference (CWE-476, CWE-754)

[Affected Code Base]
janus-gateway (https://github.com/meetecho/janus-gateway) - Affected: v0.0.9-v0.10.0

[Affected Component]
affected source code file: /janus-gateway/sdp.c
affected function: janus_sdp_process
affected executable: janus

[Attack Type]
Remote

[Impact]
Denial of Service

[Attack Vectors]
To describe multimedia communication sessions, a web browser client
and Janus communicates through SDP protocol
(https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4566). To exploit the vulnerability, a
web browser client must send a valid SDP offer packet with an
incomplete session-level attribute, such as "a=fingerprint". As shown
in RFC (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4566#page-21), a session-level
attribute may either have a value or be empty.

SDP request is then parsed inside of "janus_sdp_parse" function which
transforms session-level attribute from a string representation into
the "janus_sdp_attribute" struct. Because of incompletion, the "value"
field of this struct will be "NULL".

When the SDP request is transferred from a string representation into
"janus_sdp" struct it's then passed into "janus_sdp_process" function.
It processes session-level attributes of the SDP request and has the
NULL dereference vulnerability when working with "a->value" part of
the struct.

Link to vulnerable code [2]: https://github.com/meetecho/janus-gateway/blob/v0.10.0/sdp.c#L74

[Vulnerability Type]
NULL pointer dereference (CWE-476, CWE-754)

[Affected Code Base]
janus-gateway (https://github.com/meetecho/janus-gateway) - Affected: v0.9.0-v0.10.0

[Affected Component]
affected source code file: /janus-gateway/sdp.c
affected function: janus_sdp_preparse
affected executable: janus

[Attack Type]
Remote

[Impact]
Denial of Service

[Attack Vectors]
To describe multimedia communication sessions, a web browser client
and Janus communicates through SDP protocol
(https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4566). To exploit the vulnerability, a
web browser client must send a valid SDP offer packet with an
incomplete media-level attribute corresponding to either audio or
video mid attribute, such as "m=audio 1 ffff 0\r\na=mid". As shown in
RFC (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4566#page-21), a session-level
attribute may either have a value or be empty.

SDP request is then parsed inside of janus_sdp_parse function which
transforms media-level attribute from a string representation into the
"janus_sdp_attribute" struct. Because of incompletion, the "value"
field of this struct will be "NULL".

When the SDP request is transferred from a string representation into
"janus_sdp" struct it's then passed into "janus_sdp_preparse"
function. It validates and preparses the given SDP request. Inside of
media-level attributes processing NULL dereference happens

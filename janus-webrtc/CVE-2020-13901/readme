[ Description ]
An issue was discovered in janus-gateway (aka Janus WebRTC Server) through 0.10.0.
janus_sdp_merge in sdp.c has a stack-based buffer overflow.

Link to vulnerable code [1]: https://github.com/meetecho/janus-gateway/blob/v0.10.0/sdp.c#L1248

[Vulnerability Type]
Buffer Overflow

[Affected Code Base]
janus-gateway (https://github.com/meetecho/janus-gateway) - Affected: v0.3.0-v0.10.0

[Affected Component]
affected source code file: /janus-gateway/sdp.c
affected function: janus_sdp_merge
affected executable: janus

[Attack Type]
Remote

[Impact]
Code execution,
Denial of Service

[Attack Vectors]
To exploit the vulnerability, someone needs to use the method to merge
a stripped session description and the right transport information of
an SDP packet. This function is "janus_sdp_merge" and it parses
media-level attributes depending on the "mid" type
(audio/video/application). Stack buffer overflow happens in
"JANUS_SDP_APPLICATION" processing because the stack "buffer" variable
has the size of 2048 bytes and "g_strlcat" is called with the maximum
"JANUS_BUFSIZE" bytes (which is 8192). So, an attacker can specify one
media-level attribute with 'm->proto == "UDP/DTLS/SCTP"' with 512
bytes in size and multiple application media-level attributes with
'm->proto == "JUNKJUNKJUNK"' with 512 bytes in size and these
attributes will overwrite the frame stack boundaries (canary / ret
overwriting)
